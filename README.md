Stop to delivery emails every time you change it!

Maily is a Rails Engine to preview, follow up, test and edit the emails of your applications in the browser.

## Features:

* Mountable engine
* Visual preview in the browser (attachments as well)
* Template edition
* Email delivery
* Features configurables per environment
* Customizable parent controller (define permissions in your own controller)
* Minimalistic interface (thanks to [@gnatok](https://github.com/gnatok))
* Easy way (named hooks) to define data for emails
* Generator to handle a comfortable installation

## Installation
Add this line to you Gemfile:

```
gem 'maily'
```

Run generator:

```
rails g maily:install
```

This installator makes some tasks for you:

* Mounts the engine (to `/maily` by default) in your routes
* Adds an initializer (into `config/initializers/maily.rb`) to customize some settings
* Adds a file (into `lib/maily_hooks.rb`) to define hooks

## Initialization and configuration
You should configure Maily via this initializer. You can set these options per environment:

```ruby
  Maily.enabled = ENV['MAILY_ENABLED']
```

This is a sample of the file with the full list of options:

```ruby
# config/initializers/maily.rb
Maily.setup do |config|
  # Enable/disable engine
  # config.enabled = Rails.env.production? ? false : true

  # Allow to edit templates
  # config.allow_edition = Rails.env.production? ? false : true

  # Allow deliveries
  # config.allow_delivery = Rails.env.production? ? false : true

  # Define I18n available locales
  # config.available_locales = [:en, :es, :pt, :fr]

  # Define parent controller. Allow to run engine under a custom controller
  # config.base_controller = '::AdminController'
end
```

### Templates edition (`allow_edition` option)
This feature was designed for `development` environment. Since it's just a file edition and running `production` mode, code is not reloaded between requests, Rails doesn't take in account this change (without restarting the server). Also, allow arbitrary ruby code evaluation is potentially dangerous, that's not a good idea for `production`.

So, templates edition is not allowed running `production` mode.


## Hooks
Most of emails need to populate data to consume it and do intersting things. Hooks are used to define this data with a little DSL. Example:

```ruby
# lib/maily_hooks.rb
user = User.new(email: 'user@example.com')
comment = Struct.new(:body).new('Lorem ipsum') # stub way
service = FactoryGirl.create(:service) # using fixtures with FactoryGirl

Maily.hooks_for('Notifier') do |mailer|
  mailer.register_hook(:welcome, user, template_path: 'users')
  mailer.register_hook(:new_comment, user, comment)
end

Maily.hooks_for('PaymentNotifier') do |mailer|
  mailer.register_hook(:invoice, user, service)
end
```

Note that you are able to override `template_path` like can be done in Rails. You must pass this option as a hash and last argument:

```ruby
Maily.hooks_for('YourMailerClass') do |mailer|
  mailer.register_hook(:your_mail, template_path: 'notifications')
end
```

## Customize Authorization
By default `Maily` runs under `ActionController::Base`, but you are able to customize that parent controller (`Maily.base_controller` option) in order to achieve (using `before_action`) a kind of access control. For example, set a different base controller:

```ruby
Maily.setup do |config|
  ...
  config.base_controller = '::AdminController'
  ...
end
```

And write your own authorization rules in the defined `base_controller`:

```ruby
class AdminController < ActionController::Base
  before_action :maily_authorized?

  private

  def maily_authorized?
    (current_user && current_user.admin?) || raise("You don't have access to this section!")
  end
end
```

## Notes
Rails 4.1 introduced a built-in mechanism to preview the application emails. It is in fact a port of [basecamp/mail_view](https://github.com/basecamp/mail_view) gem to the core.

Alternatively, there are some other plugins to get a similar functionality with different approaches and options. For example, [ryanb/letter_opener](https://github.com/ryanb/letter_opener), [sj26/mailcatcher](https://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher) or [glebm/rails_email_preview](https://github.com/glebm/rails_email_preview).
